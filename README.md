## 💡 About This Project

Preparing for the HEC USAT can be challenging, especially when it's hard to find high-quality, organized past papers. This repository was created to solve that problem.

The goal is to be a central, easy-to-navigate collection of all available USAT past papers to help you prepare for your university admissions. This is a community-driven project, meaning it grows and gets better with contributions from students like you.

## 🗂️ How This Repository is Organized

All materials are organized into folders. You can browse the folders above and download any PDF you need. No special software is required.

The structure is based on the USAT test categories:

* **/USAT-Engineering (USAT-E):** Contains past papers for students applying to Engineering programs.
* **/USAT-Medical (USAT-M):** Contains past papers for Pre-Medical students.
* **/USAT-Arts-Humanities (USAT-A):** For students in Arts & Humanities.
* **/USAT-Computer-Science (USAT-CS):** For Computer Science applicants.
* **/USAT-General-Science (USAT-GS):** For General Science students.
* **/USAT-Commerce (USAT-Com):** For Commerce students.
* **/Shared-Materials:** Contains subject-specific guides (e.g., Verbal Reasoning tips, Quantitative Reasoning formulas) that apply to all test types.
